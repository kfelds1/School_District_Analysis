# School District Analysis

One surprising discovery is that the average reading scores and math scores at both public and charter schools are practically the same. It might be expected that the scores at charter schools would be significantly higher than the scores at public schools, but they are only slightly higher. It is also interesting that the lowest reading score is from a student at a charter school.

I think performing a more in-depth analysis on the scores broken down by school would be worthwhile. This way, we could see if there is an association between scores and certain schools. If there happen to be patterns, i.e. the students at one particular school consistently has lower scores, then there might be some difficulties with the teaching at that school.
